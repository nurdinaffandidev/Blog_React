### 🔗 What is a `<Link>` tag in React?

In React (specifically React Router), the `<Link>` component is used to navigate between pages (routes) without reloading the entire page.

> ✅ It’s the React version of an `<a href="...">` tag — but faster and smoother.

---

## 🔧 Import it from:

```js
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
```

## 🧠 Why use `<Link>` instead of `<a>`?

| `<a>` Tag                | `<Link>` Component              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Causes full page reload  | Does not reload the page        |
| Slower user experience   | Fast, client-side navigation    |
| Default browser behavior | Works with React Router history |

---

## ✅ Example:

```jsx
<Link to="/about">About Page</Link>
```

* Clicking this navigates to the `/about` route
* React Router updates the **URL and view** without reloading

---

## 🧰 Real-world use:

```jsx
function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link> | 
      <Link to="/blogs">Blogs</Link> | 
      <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Make sure:

* You wrap your app in `<BrowserRouter>` (usually in `App.js` or `index.js`)
* The `to` prop matches a defined `<Route path="..." />`
