## üî∑ What is `BrowserRouter` in React?

`BrowserRouter` is a router component from the `react-router-dom` library.
It enables client-side routing in a React application using the **HTML5 history API**.

> ‚úÖ It lets your React app change views/pages without reloading the whole browser page.

## üîß Basic Usage Example:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./Home";
import About from "./About";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

## üß† How it works:

* `BrowserRouter` watches the URL (e.g., `/about`)
* When the URL changes, it loads the correct React component (`<About />`) without refreshing the page
* It keeps the UI in sync with the URL

| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `BrowserRouter` | Wraps the whole app, manages routing |
| `Routes`        | Contains all `<Route>` elements      |
| `Route`         | Defines path ‚Üí component mapping     |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:

* Only use **one** `<BrowserRouter>` in your app.
* Make sure your server is configured to handle route paths (especially for deployment).
